# SciKitFin

SciKitFin is a python module for multi-asset quantitative finance specifically dedicated to the pricing of financial derivatives and risk-neutral simulation of underlyings.

The project was started by Alexandre Moulti as side project levaring his previous open-source projects and knowledge in multi-asset quantitative modelling.

The philosophy of this library is based on 3 pillars :
- ready to use for real-life applications. The objective is to be used by structurers, asset managers, ALM practitioners or students
- multi-asset by default with the objective to describe correctly the most representative instruments of a currency zone.
- easy to use, hack and compound
