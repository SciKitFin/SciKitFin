# SciKitFin

SciKitFin is a python module for multi-asset quantitative finance specifically dedicated to the pricing of financial derivatives and risk-neutral simulation of underlyings.

This library has been started by Alexandre Moulti leveraging his previous projects and expertise in multi-asset modelling.

The philosophy of this library is based on 3 pillars :
- market centric. The objective is to be used by professionals (structurers, asset managers, ALM practitioners) in real-life applications.
- multi-asset by default with the objective to describe correctly the most traded instruments of a currency zone
- easy to use, hack and integrate in daily production systems
